            <h3><a href="http://www.escape.ncl.com/the_Ship#aqua-park" target="_blank">FUN:</a></h3>
            <p>Looking for something fun to do?  Try the Norwegian Escape's two-story ropes course where you can literally walk the plank over the ship's side and stand stories above the water's surface.  Or enjoy the largest Aqua Park at sea.  There are slides for the more conservative, but if you're a dare-devil, try the free-fall slide where the floor drops out from under you, or challenge a friend to a race on the Tandem water slides. You can also play mini-golf, go rock climbing, enjoy the sports courts, or rock-out to the live-music available in multiple venues, like the first Margaritaville at Sea! Or try your luck at the casino onboard the ship! Plus, kids and teens have clubs with activities catered specifically for their age groups.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://www.escape.ncl.com/dining#all" target="_blank">Freestyle Dining:</a></h3>
            <p>Any time, anywhere, however you like and with whomever you like: That's freestyle dining.  And NCL makes sure you have more dining choices than you have days on the cruise.  In addition to at least three complimentary main dining rooms and several more casual complimentary dining options, the NCL Escape will feature high-quality premium dining venues from famous chefs, like Iron Chef's Jose Garces and Cake Boss' Buddy Valastro.</p>
            <p>And what would a cruise be without a drink or two?  The Escape has a bar for every palate and every location.  In particular, beer lovers can enjoy a craft brew on tap at The District Brew House, and wine afficionados can partake of a wine-tasting at The Cellars, a Michael Mondavi Family wine bar.</p>

            <p>What kind of entertainment are you looking for?  The opportunity to rock out with a drink in hand?  Try Margaritaville or the District Brew House, or for dinner and dancing, try The Manhattan Room.  Plus, in addition to Headliner's Comedy Club, The Escape also features three award-winning Broadway shows, each focusing on a distinct era of American music: In <strong>After Midnight</strong> be transported to the 20's in the Cotton Club with the big band sounds of Duke Ellington; in <strong>Million Dollar Quartet</strong> relive one of the "greatest jam sessions of all time" (or at least of the 50's) with the music of Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley; and in <strong>For the Record: Dear John Hughes</strong>, be transported to the 80s as you relive the music and storylines of the teenage classics by John Hughes, like "Don't You Forget About Me" in <i>The Breakfast Club</i>. </p>

            <h3>New Cruiser Tips</h3>
            <p>If you're new to cruising, here's a compilation of videos that have helpful tips, especially for the first day of cruising.</p>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
              <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL5sPkgpX0pW6UfEKLqYGRKDT02hQ6Vl2f" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <br>
            <p>Ok, here's the low-down:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Get There!:</strong> Arrive to the port early.  Passengers are allowed to start boarding as early as 11AM, and can board as late as 2:00PM. (NOTE: The ship's itinerary <em>does</em> say that she leaves at 4, but it also says that all passengers must be onboard two-hours prior to departure.)  If you're flying to Miami, NCL offers airport-to-pier transfers.  If you're driving, parking rates are $20 per day.</li>
              <li><strong>CREDIT CARD NEEDED:</strong> The cruise line will require you to have a credit card on file with them for any charges you've accumulated over the course of your cruise.</li>
              <li><strong>EXPLORE:</strong> The ship is frickin' huge.  If you have time the very first day, explore some of the more important venues.  This way, when someone says meet me by the bar near the waterslides, you'll have some idea as to where they mean.</li>
              <li><strong>READ:</strong> Every evening your cabin steward will give you a newsletter that details the events that are happening that day, any specials going on, and a list of activities scheduled throughout the day.  Also, you can check the menus on your tv screen for any of the restaurants onboard the ship so you can plan and/or make reservations if you want.</li>
              <li><strong>RESEARCH:</strong> Do your homework, research the ship beforehand.  Here's a few links to get you started: <a href="http://www.ncl.com/" target="_blank">NCL.com</a>, <a href="http://boards.cruisecritic.com">Cruise Critic Message Boards</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> (I picked out a few videos to include in the Playlists above, but YouTube has boatloads(pun intended) of informational videos on absolutely every topic.  You may want to look at cruises from the NCL Getaway, the Escape's sister ship and until the Escape sails, the fleet's newest ship.)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="qaHolder">
              <h4 class="question">Do I need a passport?</h4>
              <p class="answer">Technically, no.  If you do not have a passport, you must have both a birth certificate and another form of ID.  <strong>BUT passports are strongly encouraged!</strong><br><br>
                If you miss the ship while in a port of call, or an emergency situation should occur during your trip, a passport is required to fly home.  Without a passport, you will have to wait to go home via ship only.
              </p>

            <div class="qaHolder">
              <h4 class="question">Where is the port and which airport do I fly to?</h4>
              <p class="answer"> The Norwegian Escape will be leaving from the port of Miami, and if you choose to fly, try finding a flight that arrives in the MIA airport.
                To find driving directions and more information about the port, visit <a href="http://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=1761" target="_blank">this site.</a>

              <h4 class="question">What time do I have to be at the port?</h4>
              <p class="answer">On Saturday May 7, 2016, you can start boarding as early as 11AM but you <strong>MUST be there by 2:00PM!</strong><br><br>
                For the rest of the ports, NCL requires that you arive back to the ship at least 30 minutes prior to departure time.

                      <p>
                    </li>

              <h4 class="question">If I drive, can I park at the port?</h4>
              <p class="answer">The Miami port does have parking.  The rates are $20 per day for standard sized cars; oversized cars are $40 per day.</p>

            <div class="qaHolder">
              <h4 class="question">What are some other expenses I should budget for?</h4>
              <div class="answer withDiv">
                <ul>Tips:
                  <li>Luggage handlers: $1 per bag</li>
                  <li>Daily Service Charge: $12.95 per person per day(~$84 per person). This will be added to your bill automatically.  See </li>
                  <li>Room Steward: (Optional, but recommended since your room steward is the one person who will serve you routinely and repeatedly.)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul>Transportation:
                  <li>Getting back from the wedding:  Budget at least $8 per person for a taxi cab to take you to your next destination.</li>
                  <li>Getting from the airport to the cruise terminal:  You have several options, including booking pre-arranged shuttle via NCL, grabbing a taxi at the airport($27.00 flat rate), or using public transportation.  Once your flight is booked, contact Helaine if you'd like to arrange for a transfer from NCL.</li>
                  <li>Excursions:  If you intend to do an independent excursion (not booked through the ship) you may want to plan on hiring a taxi to take you from location to location. (Taxis are usually easy to come by near the ship, but prices will vary from location to location.)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul>Excursions and Shopping:
                  <li>The price of shore excursions is <strong>not</strong> included in the price of your cruise fare. You <strong>CAN</strong> book independent excursions, but be careful; the ones booked through NCL either onboard the ship or online guarantee the boat will wait for you if you're running late, whereas independent excursions make no such guarantee. That said, it's in the tour operators' best interests to ensure that they're back in time for the ship, and often you can find a better excursion for a cheaper price independently.</li>
                  <li>The boat and every port of call has a gift shop area, and some say that shopping is half the fun of the trip. Most locations will accept US dollars, but to be on the safe side, you might want to bring a credit card as well.</li>
                </ul>

              <h4 class="question">Do I need to bring a credit card?</h4>
              <p class="answer">Yes.  When you check in and get your room key, your picture will be taken and they'll ask you for a credit card to cover any charges you incur on the ship. You will use your room key for any purchases onboard the ship. (Please note that a <em>CREDIT</em> card is strongly recommended instead of a <em>debit</em> card.  With a debit card, you run the risk of having a negative balance without being aware of it.  </p>

              <h4 class="question">Can I bring alchohol or other beverages onboard the ship?</h4>
              <p class="answer">According to <a href="http://www.ncl.com/faq#can-i-bringing-alcohol-board">NCL's FAQ page</a>, "All guests are prohibited from bringing alcohol on board our ships. Please note that with the exception of Wine and Champagne, all guests are prohibited from bringing alcohol on board our ships. If you purchase any alcohol at one of our ports-of-call or in our onboard shops, we will safely store your purchase(s) and either on the final night of the cruise or the morning of debarkation it will be available for pick up in a designated area."<br><br>
                As for any bottled water or other beverages, "Guests are allowed to bring water and soda on board in their original sealed containers. There is no set limit to this amount. We strongly recommend that you carry on the beverages. No coolers of any kind are allowed onboard the ships."</p>

                <h4 class="question">Can I use my phone on the ship?</h4>
                <p class="answer">To avoid extremely high phone bills, you need to keep your phone on airplane mode for the duration of the trip. Airplane mode shuts off data and cellular services but still allows you to use other functions, such as your phone's wi-fi, camera, and music player (download your music to your phone!)<br><br>Note that St. Thomas is part of the US Virgin Islands; some carriers will allow you to use your phone in St. Thomas without incurring data roaming fees.  Contact your carrier to be sure!</p>

                <h4 class="question">We have a large group; how can we stay connected while on the ship?</h4>
                <p class="answer">Passengers can call from room to room for free, but NCL also has an app called iConcierge available in both Google Play Store and Apple's App Store that will enable passengers to text and call others with the iConcierge app.  Read more about the <a href="http://www.ncl.com/sites/default/files/iCONCIERGE_05132014.pdf">iConcierge App</a>.</p>

                <h4 class="question">Does the ship have Wi-Fi?</h4>
                <p class="answer">Yes.  It's slow, unreliable, and expensive, but they have it if you absolutely need it.</p>
