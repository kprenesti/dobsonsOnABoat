## About DobsonsOnABoat.com
This is a wedding website for a couple who will be having a destination wedding via cruise ship. My clients wanted a website that would provide as much information as possible about both the wedding and the cruise.  As many of their guests were first-time cruisers, the emphasis for the cruise page was to provide a reference of things their guests would need to know about cruising in general and for the Norwegian Escape in particular.
